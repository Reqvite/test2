        <h2>Lawful Basis for Processing</h2>
        <p>
          Under the General Data Protection Regulation (&quot;GDPR&quot;), if
          you are a resident of the European Economic Area (&quot;EEA&quot;), we
          process your personal information based on one or more of the
          following lawful bases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your explicit consent;</li>
          <li>The performance of a contract between you and the Site;</li>
          <li>Compliance with our legal obligations;</li>
          <li>To protect your vital interests;</li>
          <li>To perform a task carried out in the public interest;</li>
          <li>
            For our legitimate interests, provided they do not override your
            fundamental rights and freedoms.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Retention of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          We will retain your Personal Information for our records when you
          place an order through the Site, unless you request that we erase this
          information. For more information on your right of erasure, please see
          the &quot;Your Rights&quot; section below.
        </p>
        <h2>Automatic Decision-Making</h2>
        <p>
          If you are an EEA resident, you have the right to object to processing
          based solely on automated decision-making (including profiling), when
          it has a legal effect on you or significantly affects you otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&nbsp;<em>[DO/DO NOT]</em>&nbsp;engage in fully automated
          decision-making that has a legal or otherwise significant effect using
          customer data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our processor Shopify uses limited automated decision-making to
          prevent fraud that does not have a legal or otherwise significant
          effect on you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of services that include elements of automated
          decision-making are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Temporary denylist of IP addresses associated with repeated failed
            transactions. This denylist persists for a small number of hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Temporary denylist of credit cards associated with denylisted IP
            addresses. This denylist persists for a small number of days.
